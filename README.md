# Macroeconomic-Theory
A 12 classes introductory course in Macroeconomics


This course presents macroeconomic modeling at an intermediate level. We will cover three core models that are the basis for many more advanced and complex models used in the field. A strong grasp of the benchmark models is a necessary preliminary step both to go to more advanced topics and maybe more importantly to fully understand the basic economic channels that are almost always present even in more complex models. The course also presents the mathematical methods that are used both to specify and to solve the benchmark models. These methods are interesting by themselves as they can be applied to many other questions and fields.

Below you find links to Jupyter Notebooks that contain the slides and the material of the course. You also find links to web based presentation of the class.Beware that sometimes notebook do not render in Github. In that case you need to download it and open it with jupyter locally.

Infinite-Horizon

In the first class we lay down the framework for the course's map and present the Ramsey- Cass-Koopman model. We build on the Solow Model and endogenise the consumption-saving decision. The resulting model is known as the Ramsey-Cass-Koopman models.


### Learning curve

Micro-foundations of saving-consumption behavior
The concept of welfare
The steady state and the dynamics (phase diagram)
Comparative statics on parameters
Government expenditure in the model

### Methods
The solve the model we need to learn how optimal control. The solution of the model consists in a system of differential equations.
